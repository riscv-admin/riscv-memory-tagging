Memory Tagging Task Group (TG) Charter  [draft]
Define a memory tagging ISA extension that can be used by software to enforce memory tag checks on memory loads and stores. Motivation for memory tagging ISA extension is to provide primitives for safer memory management and is covered in detail in memory safety whitepaper [1]. A very high level design direction set by runtime integrity SIG for memory tagging TG is based upon the following criteria. Refer to the summary in the whitepaper [1] for additional details on criteria that were analyzed by the SIG. 

The Memory tagging TG’s deliverables include:
1. An ISA extension specification that can be used by software to to enforce memory tag check
   on memory loads and stores.

	- The ISA should be deployable in production with ability to turn on/off capability on the
	  same  binary and address space.
    - The ISA should enable software to cover both Temporal and Spatial Safety models.
    - The delivered ISA extension should fulfill the following criteria:
		- Applicable to ISAs with at least 64-bit addresses (e.g. RV64, RV128) only; not applicable
		  to RV32
		- Virtual address accesses subject to tag checks (tag checks not applicable to physical
		  address accesses)
		- Tag programming must happen via dedicated instructions
		- Fault reporting: synchronous (min) and asynchronous both
		- Granularity: 16 bytes must be supported, other than 16 byte granularity optional and may 
		  depend on configuration.
		- Tag size: >= 4 bits
		- Usable privilege: U, S, HS, VS and M
		- Supports both implicit and explicit tag checking
		- Software control on tag checkings : enabled/disabled via a PTE bit or an unused encoding
		- Hardware assisted tag creation for portable binary (portable stack pointer creation) : Yes
		- Tag storage: Tag storage should be in virtual memory of workload’s address space and 		
		  indexed virtually. Tag storage must be protected from being accessible via regular loads and stores and access must happen in secure manner (in case of M-mode or bare mode, virtual = physical)

2. A definition of dependencies (ISA, non-ISA) for the ISA extension.

3. The following Proofs of Concept (PoCs):
	- Compiler (gcc, clang), privileged software, and emulator/simulator (Linux kernel, QEMU, 
	  spike, sail) enabled to support memory tagging.
	- Enable a major application (preferably a browser), spec benchmark (SPECint), and a major 
	  managed runtime (OpenJDK and golang?) for memory tagging  
	- Collect metrics on code size growth for major applications / SPEC benchmarks.
